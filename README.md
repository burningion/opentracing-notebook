# OpenTracing Example Notebook

This is an example Jupyter notebook to show how to get started with OpenTracing in Python. Currently a WIP, but you can preview the notebook [here](https://github.com/burningion/opentracing-notebook/blob/master/Python%20OpenTracing%20Quickstart%20.ipynb).

## Getting it Running

In order to run the notebook, you'll need to have both Python 3 and Docker installed.

Once they're both set up, you can do a `pip install jupyter`, and then `cd` into this repo's directory and `jupyter notebook`. 

A web browser window (or url) will then pop up, and you'll be able to interactively download and run the necesary Docker instances, along with required Python libraries.

Pressing SHIFT+ENTER on a cell makes it get run, if it contains code. You can double click on any cell (text or code), and edit it. The code runs as if you were sending each cell into an interactive session.
